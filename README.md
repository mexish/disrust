# What is this ?
Disrust is a TUI discord client written entirely in glorious Rust. It works*. 

The app is not fully feature complete. It's missing a lot of discord features, but the basics like navigating between servers, viewing channels, sending messages, etc are there. I might eventually just rewrite it entirely from scratch.

This is made purely for educational purposes.

# Now, you might be asking yourself:

<details>
<summary><b>But is this legal ?</b></summary>
<b>No.</b>

The use of this app is very much not kosher according to discord's TOS. I do not recommend using it seriously.

# Installation
- You need to have Rust and cargo installed in order to compile the code
- Download the code in .zip or ```git clone``` it wherever you like
- Go into that directory and run ```cargo run```
- Paste your user token in when the program prompts for it. If you don't know what that is, look up a video on youtube or smthn

# Controls
- Use arrows to navigate.
- Press ```e``` to enter editing mode and ```esc``` to leave it
- Press ```enter``` to open a server and view channels or send a message if you are in editing mode
- Press ```esc``` to leave a server if not in editing mode
- Press ```q``` to quit the app

# Credits and final comments

Thanks to <b>Traumatism</b> (https://github.com/Traumatism) and their project <b>ToastCord</b> (https://github.com/Traumatism/ToastCord) for guidance. This would have been a lot more confusing to code without them.

Thanks to <b>6cord</b> (https://github.com/diamondburned/6cord) for the initial inspiration
